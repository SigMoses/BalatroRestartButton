# BalatroMods
Some small Balatro QoL mods I wrote. Tested on Balatro 1.0.1o and Steamodded 1.0.0 beta (0323b)

## Restart Run Button
Adds a button to restart the current run to the escape menu and game over screen.
I was annoyed that the R key for restarting the current run doesn't work on the game over screen, requiring you to go back to the deck selection screen to start a new run.

This mod does exactly the same thing as holding R normally would.

## Brainstorm Reroll Button
If you use Brainstorm's auto reroll and you want an easier way to trigger it after losing a run, this mod is for you.
This is also useful on the (unofficial) mobile version, where obviously you normally don't have a keyboard to activate the key combinations, so this is the only way to use Brainstorm on mobile.

Similar to Restart Run Button, a button is added to both the escape menu and game over screen, which triggers the same function as the Ctrl+A key combination.
